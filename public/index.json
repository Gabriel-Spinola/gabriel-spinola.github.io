Also, I spend a lot of my free time working on game dev projects.\nMy coding journey started when I was twelve by building a Python calculator, then failing miserably to write a game using Java and a random graphics framework that I don\u0026rsquo;t remember the name of. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve been using a multitude of tools and languages, and what I can take from that is I must use what\u0026rsquo;s best for the given problem and have fun learning it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m currently on a Mobile job and learning low level programming.\nMore on my work: #\rLinkedin Github Experiences #\rWeb Development assistent at Senai CTTI MG: Engaged in practical and theoretical activities, including: Front-end client-side development, programming logic, PHP, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, as well as database development and integration.
