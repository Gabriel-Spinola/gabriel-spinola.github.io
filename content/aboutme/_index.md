# Hi!
I’m a Brazilian software engineer. I’m particularly interested in complex systems, competitions, and technology research. Also, I spend a lot of my free time working on game dev projects.

My coding journey started when I was twelve by building a Python calculator, then failing miserably to write a game using Java and a random graphics framework that I don't remember the name of. Since then, I've been using a multitude of tools and languages, and what I can take from that is I must use what's best for the given problem and have fun learning it.

I'm currently on a Mobile job and learning low level programming.
